# CMS_Project

I made this project Content Management System using the web development tools i.e html,css,bootstrap,javascript and main tool was PHP. All the functionalities(almost 80% )
are through PHP. I am still working on the project features and additional functionalities, but if you want to see the project, then follow the steps to run the code on 
your system.

HOW TO RUN CMS ON YOUR SYSTEM.

1. Download and extract the files.
2. Make sure you have any localhost provider like xammpp, ammps etc. 
3. If you are using xammpp, open the apache and mysql server. Open phpMyAdmin and create a database named CMS.
4. Click on import and select the file "cms.sql",which is in the folder named IMPORT_SQL_FILES.
5. Make sure to change the localhost username or password in the folder (all_includes->db.php) if you are not using xammpp or you want to change the database name , then make
   sure to change it in db.php as well, then only it will make a connection with your database.
6. Put the cms extracted folder in xammpp->htdocs->(yourFolderName) . Make sure to change the include locations as per your system's location.
7. Run it on your localhost.
8. To open the Admin section- you have to login with username-faiz and password-1234.
